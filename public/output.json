Servers may accept an identifier based reference untouched, resolve it, and/or reject it - see CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.referencePolicy.\nWhen both an identifier and a literal reference are provided, the literal reference is preferred.

For example, it would not be legitimate to send the identifier for a drug prescription if the type were Reference(Observation|DiagnosticReport).

Immunologic testing may provide supporting evidence for the basis of the reaction and the causative substance, but no tests are 100% sensitive or specific for sensitivity to a particular substance.

For example a pill pack of 21 tablets plus 7 sugar tablets, can be denoted here as '28 tablets'. This attribute is repeatable so that the different item types in one pack type can be counted (e.g. a count of vials and count of syringes). Each repeat must have different units, so that it is clear what the different sets of counted items are, and it is not intended to allow different counts of similar items (e.g. not '2 tubes and 3 tubes'). Repeats are not to be used to represent different pack sizes (e.g. 20 pack vs. 50 pack) - which would be different instances of this resource."
